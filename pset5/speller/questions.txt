0.  According to Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary,
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a
pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of very fine
silicate or quartz dust.
1.  The function getrusage is used to examine the resource usage of a process. 
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Resource-Usage.html)
2.  There are 16 members in a varibale of type struct rusage. 
(http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrusage.2.html)
3.  We pass structs by reference because passing them by 
value is slow and takes up memory potentially leading to 
a stackover flow since the structs will be placed on the stack.
4.  fgetsc gets successive characters from the file. Upon getting a character,
if the character is an apostrophe or alphabet, the character is added to the array.
Should the character length be larger than tht maximum length,
the array is reset/cleared and thus sset for the next word.
If the character is a digit, the array is cleared and prepared 
for the next word. If otherwise, i.e if the character is neither
a digit, alphabet or an apostrophe and the character length
is larger than 0, a whole word must have been found. 
At this point, the array is updated with a null zero value. 
5.  fscanf with a format string like "%s" will read subsequent characters 
    until a whitespace is found (whitespace characters are considered to be 
    blank, newline and tab). Because words within the txt files sometimes 
    end with punctuation, fscanf will view them as being part of the word, 
    which complicates the reading procedure. In addition, if a longer string
    than expected was read using fscanf (e.g. a jibberish string like asdfba
    asdkdfawemflkasciaoeufalkesfasldkfjaoiwefjaslkdmcalksdfiwoefalskdfamsdcl
    asdflkasdlkmceaasdfasdf..., which could be included in a text file from
    a malicious source that is trying to break our program), we could 
    overwrite important data in memory or cause a segmentation fault.

6.  Declaring the parameters as const tells the compiler that the specified values
have constant values. This allows the compiler to place the values in read-only memory 
which prevents changes to the values in question.
